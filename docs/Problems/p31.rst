P31 (Easy)
============

This problem was asked by **Google**.

Problem statement
=================

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the other. For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three: substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.
Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.


Ideas
=====

This problem needs Dynamic Programming. 
Define the problem state to be OPT(str1, str2).

Recursive case：

OPT(str1,str2) = OPT(str1[1:], str[1:]) + 1 # if str1[0] != str2[0], and substitution, addition, deletion is carried out
OPT(str1, str2) = OPT(str1[1:], str[1:]) # 


I can have two pointers pointing to the two strings.
